# Overthrow-Martial-Law

## Welcome to Martial Law where YOU are the Resistance
This is the link to my Discord for Martial Law. . . https://discord.gg/ZdMMq9x

This is a modified version of Overthrow made by Armazac and edited by Gerhart with the help of many great people. Huge thanks to all that have helped.
Play Singleplayer using local/lan, co-op, multiplayer. Made for 1-2 players but has slots up to 10 for those that want it. Over 2 players may eventually cause issues.
DO NOT use any other AI mods, this contains an older version of Vcom and Lamb's Danger FSM. If you attempt to use other AI mods it will bug out. If I can figure out how to update these to the latest it will be done, until then they work fine as it is. If I can get this up on Github I will do so.

### HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO USE THE CBA SETTINGS IN THE DISCUSSION AREA AND THEN ADJUST ACCORDING TO YOUR WANT/DESIRES/NEEDS

FYI : There will be a 5 second delay at the beginning where the player will be on "spawn island". Only be concerned if it is longer than that.

Please read before downloading/subscribing
DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF. . .
1. You feel entitled. I made this for myself and decided to share it
2. You like to micromanage your AI. The AI in Martial Law may or may not listen to you, they have their own fears, agendas and survival instincts.
3. You want to use other faction/AI/weapons/vehicle mods. Use only those listed that are needed or the mods that are listed under optional. I've been working hard at trying to balance things out but it is still a Work In Progress. Using any other mods other than those that are indicated WILL mess with the mod and the experience you get with it.
4. You want to play with more than 2 people. There are slots up to 10 but just like the original OT it will cause issues if over 2 players.

Highly Suggested Options
1. Since this uses Ace and Vandeanson's Apocalypse go through the CBA settings to adjust according to your needs/wants/desires.
2. Settings for Vandeanson's Apocalypse: Use World loot NOT Dynamic loot. 100%building chance, 10-15%per position.
3. Look at the CBA settings I have in the discussion area. These have been tested and I am still updating them as I continue.
4. Don't do the starting tutorial as it can bug out plus is not needed. You'll get a gun soon enough when bandits start fighting the police in town. . . loot up.

There have been changes and fixes that have been done in this mod compared to the original Overthrow. I don't recall all of them but here are a few.
1. Businesses have been redone/removed/added on each map.
2. Any armored vests and helmets ARE illegal the exceptions are hard helmets, bike helmets and skater helmets.
3. Handheld flashlights are legal but NVG's are still a no no.
4. Additional Bases, Comms and checkpoints have been added to the maps.
5. Things are more expensive because : Tyrannical Gov't, Martial Law declared, economy going bust, future scenario, Scum bag gun dealers taking advantage to line their pockets etc. . .
6. Gang relationship not so grindy and are a great souce of cannon fodder.
7. Crafting table is very useful now, check out the recipes.
8. Nato has a ton of resources to use and play with so be prepared to fall back and rethink your strategy.
9. Jobs have been fixed.
10. Some maps have additional Towns added oh and secrets too
11. Current playable maps: Altis, Livonia, Malden, Tanoa. Plan to add more

I do have others but this is good enough for now. . .just ask if a mod can possibly work.


Because this mod uses Ace3 and Vandeanson's Apocalypse it is extremely customizable in the CBA settings.
I would suggest for Vandeanson's to only use the World Loot and NOT the Dynamic loot. I do have my own personal settings if people are interested in trying them out. I made one for each map so things may be slighly different on each one. These are located in the discussions area and are only the standard settings for the mods that are needed. I held back the settings for the optional mods. I would also HIGHLY suggest that you make backup copies of Ace3, Vandeanson's Apocalypse and CBA and store them on your local HDD just incase an update Fubar's some stuff.

This mod is based off of the foundation of Overthrow by ARMAzac and still uses the same guides and rules found over at www.armaoverthrow.com.
I would like to thank Armazac for the Overthrow mod and for allowing others to modify his work.
I would also like to thank the many people that have helped me and others in the community. Among those are Maxp, Mystic Shadows guys (for letting me torture them by testing in their server), Robodog, Rudyblah, GrimwaldsGaming, Vandeanson and all of those that have offered help, code and support, not only for me but for anyone who has needed it. I know I've forgotten names, damn getting old but please know that I greatly appreciate all of you.

Yes there are bugs, exploits that I am aware of and hope to take care of in the future. This is still being worked on and please note that saves MIGHT not be compatible with an update. If you find that you just can't deal with that then copy the mod to your local HDD just in case. I don't mind being told about a bug, exploit or anything else but to demand something WILL get you ignored.

Remember I made this for me and decided to share, if you like it then great, if you don't well there are other mods out there good luck and thanks for giving it a try.
